Hi, I'm getasoul!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My real name is Ayaan.

ðŸ’» I know the following languages: Python, Java, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. I also know how to make Python Discord bots and Java Minecraft mods.

ðŸ“– I am learning Angular and C++

ðŸŽ“ I am proficient, by my standards, in Python and Java. These are the languages I know how to do the most in.

ðŸ’¾ Most of my code will be posted here on GitHub so that people can use my smaller projects to learn and make bigger projects.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub page, and have a great day!
